- AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML
    - most AJAX APIs just uses JSON and not XML
    - describes the use of JS, CSS, DOM, and async HTTP
    - really means "a webpage that doesn't require a reload"
- XMLHttpRequest object (XHR) allows you to receive and process response without page reload
    - core object known to all browsers
    - jquery uses this object behind the scene
- AJAX turned the browser into a thing that hosts applications not just content like with simple HTML and CSS
- not just web development. Real coding with regression testing, TDD, etc.
- OWASP Zed Proxy Attack tool is a good baseline test to see if your web app is vulnerable
- AJAX is mostly for making requests to an external resource and loading them on your page
- typically use jquery for AJAX calls
    - React doesn't natively support AJAX
