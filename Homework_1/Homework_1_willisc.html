            </span>
            worked in a team to build OpenShift V2 and V3 Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments and deploy legacy applications in
            containers on the PaaS. Worked with AF staff to understand their environment and deploy PaaS and legacy
            applications. Once the applications were deployed, configured SOAPUI, REST, and JMeter tests to verify application
            builds. Leveraged Ansible to automate lab activities and minimize configuration time needed to provide value
            to the customer.
