Create a abstract class called 'Shape'.   It has one attribute - name:String.  It has one method, 'calculateArea', that takes no arguments and returns the area of a shape.   In 'Shape', it returns 0.00.

Create at least 3 other classes that extend from Shape that use a constructor to initialize its attributes (like height, width, radius, hypotenuse, etc...   These other shapes need to correct calculate the area of its type. 

Create a class called 'Program' that will test your classes.
