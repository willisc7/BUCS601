Create a ReactJS application that is based off the Shape assignment.   

Allow the user to pick a shape (consider using http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/toggle)    

Show the textfields required by the selected shape (height, width, radius, diameter, etc..).   Do not show all inputs for any type of shape; just show the inputs that particular shape requires.

Show the result on the page, not in the console.  (You can use the console for debugging, not for when you turn in your solution.)
