    TypeScript fundamentals
    - Improved form of Javascript with data types
    - const keeps the first value, but attributes can still be manipulated
    - Different data types give you different reserved space in memory
    - TypeScript is a superset of Javascript
    - "old javascript" = 1990-2005 roughly
    - strings can include external variables
        - const message:string = 'Hi my name is ${name}!'
    - let names:string[] = ["ab","bc"];
        - TypeScript cares what's in arrays whereas old javascript didnt
    - tuples can have different data types in the
        - let beerAbv:[string,number] = ["21","ipa"];
    - enums give a name to a set of numbers
        - enum Dock{TOP,RIGHT,BOTTOM,LEFT}
        - Dock.RIGHT will give you the RIGHT value
    - default language of Angular is TypeScript
    - enums can be achieved in javascript by using a TypeScript compiler (TSC)
    - let visible:any = true;
        - this will be initialized as boolean and can be changed later (like to a string or something else)
        - need to cast to the proper data type to use APIs like "string.length"
        - Example of casting: 
            - let len:number = (val as string).length;
    - declaring variables with 'var' can also accept any data type
    - if javascript fails to compile most times everything will not render properly, if at all
    - TypeScript introduces void or a return type that has no value
    - Example of void:
        function debugIt(msg:string):void {
            console.log(msg)
        };
    - never can be used to indicate values that should never occur
    - arrow functions are another way to define a function
        (message: string) => {};
    - undefined and null are subtypes of all other types in TypeScript
    - === is a strict equality check which means it keeps values compared intact
        var a = 1;
        var b = "1";
        if ( a === b ){
            will not return true
        }
        if ( a !== b ){
            will return true
        }o
    - in old javascript need to use parseInt to get a string to an int
    - lint and tslint can be used to check your javascript or typescript for errors or bad practices

    ***Averager code review***
    - npminit creates the package.json file
        - devDependencies dont get deployed because theyre just used for testing and writing code
        - dependencies get deployed 
    - "tsc-init" from within a folder will install things necessary for ts to run
    - jquery makes using javascript easier
        - wraps document.getElementById and stuff like that to make js easier to use
        - document.getElementById(someButton) is without jquery and with jquery its $("#getAverage")
        - need to ''"import * as $ from "jquery"' to get things following $ to feed through jquery
    - package.json specifies the main function which is a single javascript file that should be
    the starting point for the whole app
    - "npm install" will load all the packages package.json indicates and put them in npm_modules directory
    - "npm run x" will compile the app where x is defined in packages.json

    ***Control Structures***
    - contine will continue a loop instead of exiting if an if statement is invoked and you want to continue
    the loop after something happens
